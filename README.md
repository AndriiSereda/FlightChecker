# FlightChecker
Coding exercise:
That is my approach to solve a coding exercise.

The purpose is to build a REST service that would be used
 - to query the built-in .csv repositories of historical flight prices data by origin and departure
 - sanitize the datasets by removing the outliers
 - return the min and max price for the flight
 - optionally convert price range based on built-in .csv repository with currency exchange rates
